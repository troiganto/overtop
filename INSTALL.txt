Some hints on how to get this thing running.

First of all, you need node.js installed (http://nodejs.org/).

Then, you need a Webserver (like WAMP, http://www.wampserver.com/en/). Drop the repo's content on the webservers DocumentRoot. Then, open a command line in that directory.

Run
 $ npm install
 $ npm install -g grunt-cli
in that directory to automatically install dependencies (compiler and toolchain).

Then, run
 $ grunt
to build the project.

Now, head to http://localhost/ in your web browser. If no errors occured, you should be ready to go and also have a working development environment.
