Some hints on how to get this thing running.

First of all, you need node.js installed (http://nodejs.org/).

Then, run
 $ npm install
 $ npm install -g grunt-cli
in the project root folder (the folder where this file lies) to automatically install dependencies (compiler and toolchain).

Then, run
 $ grunt
to build the project.

Launch the webserver required for file hosting with
 $ node server.js

Now, head to http://localhost:8888/ in your web browser. If no errors occured, you should be ready to go and also have a working development environment.
